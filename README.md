# Project Lisbon Chair Project

## Introduction:

The Lisbon Chair Project is a project that I've created and implemented during the course "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS". <br/>
The propouse of this project was to learn more about Real-World Web Design and CSS tools as well. To achieve it, I've applied some Web Design Rules about: Typography, Colors, Images and Illustrations, Icons, Shadows and Whitespaces, and also Visual Hierarchy, all of that combinated with CSS Grid and Flexbox, result in this amazing Website.

>:pushpin: The purpose of this project was to improve my CSS skills, so I used this project to practice, I did not implement JavaScript Code. That is why the buttons are not working properly, just with some visual effects.

In this project I used these skills:

- HTML Fundamentals
 
- CSS Fundamentals with CSS Grid and Flexbox

- Web Design Fundamentals and Rules.
